#Content to talk during Alea's technical Friday

##Summary
1. Hide and show elements
2. Global variables
 * Module pattern
3. IIFE
 * Inmediately Invoked Function Expression
4. Inheritance
 * Prototyping
5. Memoization
 * In computing, memoization is an optimization technique used primarily to speed up computer programs by storing the results of expensive function calls 
and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again.
6. Hoisting (elevar, alzar, levantar):
 * It is a concept about program load order.
 * Function expressions vs function statements
  * A **Function Expression** defines a function as a part of a larger expression syntax (typically a variable assignment )
  * A **Function Declaration/Statements** defines a named function variable without requiring variable assignment. 
 * A function statement can be invoked during execution before its actual definition. 
  * This happens because before the code runs, function statements are interpreted and added to the execution stack/tcontext.
 * Function expressions are never hoisted, they are treated as assignments.
