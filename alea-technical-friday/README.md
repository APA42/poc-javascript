#Content to talk during Alea's technical Friday

##Summary
* Hide and show elements

* Hoisting (elevar, alzar, levantar):
 * It is a concept about program load order.
 * Function expressions vs function statements
  * A **Function Expression** defines a function as a part of a larger expression syntax (typically a variable assignment )
  * A **Function Declaration/Statements** defines a named function variable without requiring variable assignment. 
 * A function statement can be invoked during execution before its actual definition. 
  * This happens because before the code runs, function statements are interpreted and added to the execution stack/tcontext.
 * Function expressions are never hoisted, they are treated as assignments.

* Is a number really a number?

* Global variables
 * Module pattern

* IIFE
 * Inmediately Invoked Function Expression

* Inheritance
 * Prototyping
