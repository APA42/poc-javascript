#Content to talk during Alea's technical Friday

##Summary
1. Hide and show elements
2. Global variables
 * Module pattern
3. IIFE
 * Inmediately Invoked Function Expression
4. Inheritance
 * Prototyping
5. Memoization
6. Hoisting (elevar, alzar, levantar):
 * It is a concept about program load order.
 * Function expressions vs function statements
  * A **Function Expression** defines a function as a part of a larger expression syntax (typically a variable assignment )
  * A **Function Declaration/Statements** defines a named function variable without requiring variable assignment. 
 * A function statement can be invoked during execution before its actual definition. 
  * This happens because before the code runs, function statements are interpreted and added to the execution stack/tcontext.
 * Function expressions are never hoisted, they are treated as assignments.
